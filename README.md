# RISC Dataset Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the RISC (Remote Sensing Image Captioning) dataset, which consists of remote sensing images and their corresponding captions. The analysis explores the dataset structure, image properties, caption characteristics, and content categories to provide insights for the image captioning task using the PaliGemma model.

## 2. Dataset Structure

The RISC dataset contains **44,521 unique images** with a total of **222,605 captions** (5 captions per image). The dataset is divided into three splits:

- **Train**: 35,614 images (79.99%)
- **Validation**: 4,453 images (10.00%)
- **Test**: 4,454 images (10.00%)

The images come from three different sources:

- **NWPU**: 31,500 images (70.75%)
- **RSICD**: 10,921 images (24.53%)
- **UCM**: 2,100 images (4.72%)

Each source is proportionally distributed across the train, validation, and test splits, ensuring a balanced representation in each split.

## 3. Image Properties

All images in the dataset have a fixed resolution of **224Ã—224 pixels**, making them suitable for direct input into most vision models without resizing. The analysis of a sample of 1,000 images revealed:

- **Average file size**: 24.75 KB
- **Minimum file size**: 9.00 KB
- **Maximum file size**: 41.40 KB

The consistent image size and resolution simplify the preprocessing pipeline for the image captioning task.

## 4. Caption Analysis

### 4.1 Caption Length

The dataset contains a total of 222,605 captions with varying lengths:

- **Average caption length**: 12.09 words
- **Minimum caption length**: 5 words
- **Maximum caption length**: 51 words

The caption length distribution shows that most captions are concise, with the majority falling between 8 and 15 words.

### 4.2 Vocabulary and Common Words

The most frequent words in the captions are:

1. "there" (73,835 occurrences)
2. "some" (62,069 occurrences)
3. "many" (61,772 occurrences)
4. "green" (61,307 occurrences)
5. "trees" (51,464 occurrences)
6. "buildings" (47,143 occurrences)
7. "next" (24,639 occurrences)
8. "area" (24,355 occurrences)
9. "two" (18,839 occurrences)
10. "beside" (17,950 occurrences)

The prevalence of words like "trees," "green," and "buildings" reflects the common elements in remote sensing imagery, such as vegetation and urban structures.

### 4.3 Caption Similarity

The average Jaccard similarity between captions for the same image is **0.3458**, indicating a moderate level of diversity among the five captions for each image. This suggests that the captions provide different perspectives or focus on different aspects of the same image, which can be beneficial for training a robust image captioning model.

## 5. Content Categories

The analysis of caption content revealed several dominant categories in the dataset:

- **Vegetation**: 44.10% of captions mention vegetation-related elements (trees, forest, grass)
- **Urban**: 31.50% of captions describe urban structures (buildings, city, residential areas)
- **Landscape**: 22.56% of captions refer to landscape features (mountains, hills, fields)
- **Transportation**: 20.78% of captions mention transportation elements (roads, highways, vehicles)
- **Water**: 18.92% of captions include water bodies (rivers, lakes, oceans)
- **Infrastructure**: 10.24% of captions describe infrastructure (bridges, ports, facilities)
- **Airport**: 5.76% of captions specifically mention airports or related elements

Notably, **48.58%** of captions contain multiple categories, indicating the complex and diverse nature of remote sensing imagery. The co-occurrence analysis shows that vegetation often appears alongside urban elements and landscape features, reflecting the mixed land use patterns captured in remote sensing images.

## 6. Implications for Image Captioning

Based on the dataset analysis, several considerations emerge for the image captioning task using the PaliGemma model:

1. **Balanced Data Distribution**: The balanced distribution across train, validation, and test splits provides a solid foundation for model training and evaluation.

2. **Consistent Image Format**: The uniform image resolution simplifies the preprocessing pipeline and allows for direct integration with the PaliGemma model.

3. **Caption Diversity**: The moderate similarity between captions for the same image suggests that the model should be trained to capture different aspects and perspectives of the same scene.

4. **Domain-Specific Vocabulary**: The prevalence of certain words and categories indicates the importance of domain-specific knowledge in remote sensing image captioning. Fine-tuning PaliGemma on this vocabulary will be crucial.

5. **Multi-Category Content**: The high percentage of captions with multiple categories suggests that the model should be capable of describing complex scenes with diverse elements.

6. **Contextual Relationships**: The co-occurrence of different categories (e.g., vegetation with urban elements) highlights the importance of capturing contextual relationships in the generated captions.

## 7. Conclusion

The RISC dataset provides a rich and diverse collection of remote sensing images and captions, making it suitable for training and evaluating image captioning models. The dataset's balanced structure, consistent image format, and varied caption content offer a solid foundation for fine-tuning the PaliGemma model for the remote sensing domain.

The analysis reveals the complex nature of remote sensing imagery, with multiple categories often present in a single image. This complexity presents both challenges and opportunities for the image captioning task, requiring the model to understand and describe diverse elements and their relationships within the scene.

Future work should focus on leveraging these insights to develop effective fine-tuning strategies for the PaliGemma model, with particular attention to domain-specific vocabulary, contextual relationships, and the ability to capture multiple aspects of the same scene.
